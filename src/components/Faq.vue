      <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <p>
        A content aggregator is the process of collating/aggregating/organizing
        data spread across multiple social network services. The idea is to
        organize and ease the information retrieval process by consolidating the
        various social activities/data in such a way that user is not required
        to login on each site and perform the same activity (Virmani, 2014)
      </p>
      <p>This final-year project aims to be a content aggregator to aggregate e-commerce databases for price-comparison purposes. The main goal is to help user compare prices of products that appear on multiple platforms. I.e.: Sports gear (shoes, shirt) of the same brand and variation sold on Lazada, Shopee, Carousel, and Zalora. Instead of going to every single platform to compare the price of every single product, this app will aggregate everything and display the comparison side-by-side, as in the examples shown below. </p>
